# Skeet Game - Python and Arcade Library
A Skeet shooter game created during a college course. 
Similar to the traditional Skeet (or duck hunt) game but there are a few added features,  
like different bullet and target types. Avoid shooting the blue square, or you will get negative points.

(Programmed using Object Oriented Programming)

## Getting Started
